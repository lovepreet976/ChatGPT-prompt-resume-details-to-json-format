This Java program is designed to take user input for a resume and output it in a structured JSON format. It utilizes the org.json library, which allows us to easily create and manipulate JSON objects. Let me break down the main components of the code:

1. Imports and Main Class
At the beginning, we import the necessary classes from the org.json package and some standard Java classes like Scanner. The ResumeParser class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

2. User Input for Personal Information
We use a Scanner object to read input from the user. The program prompts the user to enter their personal information, such as name, email, phone number, and address. Each of these inputs is stored in a corresponding variable.

3. Education Section
Next, we create a JSONArray called educationArray to hold the user's educational background. The program prompts for details like degree, major, institution, and graduation year. We then create a JSONObject for this information and add it to the educationArray.

4. Work Experience Section
Similarly, we gather work experience details. We create another JSONArray called workExperienceArray and prompt the user for job title, company name, location, employment dates, and responsibilities. Responsibilities are input as a comma-separated string, which we split into an array. This information is stored in a JSONObject and added to the workExperienceArray.

5. Skills Section
We then collect the userâ€™s skills. A JSONArray named skillsArray is created, and the user is prompted to enter their skills as a comma-separated list. Each skill is trimmed of whitespace and added to the skillsArray.

6. Certifications Section
The program also gathers certification details. We create a JSONArray called certificationsArray and prompt for the certification name, issuing organization, and year obtained. This information is stored in a JSONObject and added to the certificationsArray.

7. Constructing the Final JSON Object
After collecting all the data, we construct the final JSON object named resumeJSON. This object contains all the sections we've created: personal information, education, work experience, skills, and certifications. Each section is added as a key-value pair.

8. Outputting the JSON
Finally, we print the resumeJSON object to the console in a pretty-printed format with an indentation of 4 spaces for better readability. This output represents the entire resume in JSON format, making it easy to read and use in applications that require structured data.

Conclusion
This program effectively demonstrates how to gather user input and organize it into a structured format using JSON. It highlights the importance of data structure in programming and how libraries like org.json can simplify the process of working with JSON in Java. Overall, this project has helped me understand both user input handling and JSON manipulation, which are valuable skills in software development.
